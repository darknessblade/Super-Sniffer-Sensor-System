# Super-Sniffer-Sensor-System
This project is intended for ESP-Home, combining every possible VOC gas sensor, PPM sensor into 1 unit.

List of sensors I plan to add:
MQ-2, 
MQ-3, 
MQ-4, 
MQ-5, 
MQ-6, 
MQ-7, 
MQ-8, 
MQ-9, 
MQ-131, 
MQ-135, 
MQ-136, 
MQ-137, 
MQ-138,
MQ-214, 
MG-811 or Scd41
Sen55 or  Pms5003 

Some of the MQ sensors will be removed due redundancy due to support of other sensors.

Note, I am no coder by any means, thus expect little software support from me.
